# MetrixForComplexity
Using lossless audio compression algorithmic to measure information content of musical messages. This approach base on Minimum Length Description offers a quantitative measurement for musical complexity that can analyses micro, meso and macro-scale redundancy in music. Visualisation of complexity over time of a given musical message can be use as a tool for musicology study.
